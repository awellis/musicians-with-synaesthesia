## Main points

1) Musicicians (both relative pitch and absolute pitch) are better at
   statistical learning than non-musicians.

2) There is no difference between absolute pitch and relative pitch. Having
   absolute pitch confers no advantage over relative pitch.
3) Any advantage in statistical learning is due to synaesthesia.

4) Absolute pitch confers an advantage in associative learning (color-tone),
   compared to relative pitch.


- We know that musicians have an advantage over non-musicians in statistical
  learning. But does having absolute pitch bestow any advantages over having
  only relative pitch?

- Claim: if there is such an advantage, it is only due to having synaesthetic
  abilities in addition to absolute pitch


## Ordinal regression

A positive Î² value indicates that an increase in the predictor variable x
results in an increase in the average response.

The log-odds of each possible response are defined as an additive model of the
predictor variables.

## NEW

1) a) absolute pitch confers advantage in statistical learning b) musicians are
   better than controls

2) a) we investigated synaesthetes -> advantage is due to synaesthesia   subgroup
   b) no difference between abs and rel pitch

3) response categories -> different behaviour (how often did you think that this
   triplet occurred previsously?)

4) a) dissociation: absolute pitch -> better memory b) memory for colors: no
   difference between abs pitch and synaesthesia

(5) memory of color: color reproduction -> very accurate (NOT synaesthesia that
leads to very good color reproducibility))
